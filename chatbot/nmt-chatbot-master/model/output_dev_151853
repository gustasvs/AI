and the axe
and the same thing
she's a very handsome kid
i thought it was a feature
the future is the only thing that's the point
he's just a hero
the future is the only thing i'm gonna do
she's a woman
i'm sure she's a troll
and then you are a bold one
because you are a bold one
i wish i was a good one
i'm gonna need to get you
xd
i'm a little confused
because he's a hero
i was going to say that
yes
big oof
i'm not sure you're a troll
she's gonna be a virgin
it's a feature
i'm sure she's a dog
i'm going to say the same thing
i'm a man of culture
i'm sad
but what about the reality of reality?
happy cake day
he's the only one who says 'i'm not sure'
he's a hero
to shreds you say?
i'm not sure you're a bitch
that's a lot of shit
i'm sure he's a hero
the best part of the world
imagine being a child
i'm not sure you're a towel
i'm sure they're a new country
i'm gonna need to get the joke
he's a hero
i also wish i was a child
i think you mean the one in the right
i'm not sure you're a towel
'i'm not sure you're a bitch'
i'm not sure you're a towel
i'm a good one
she's a keeper
i'm sure you're a man of culture
and then they are still in the comments
i'm gonna need to get you
