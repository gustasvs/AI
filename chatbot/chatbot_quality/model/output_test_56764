i love democracy
alexa play despacito
sky looks down
you are a bold one
obama is black
i've come to say you but i've come
never gonna grab you up
i'm sad.
i'm not gay but i'm not gay
a miserable arm
i'm not your daddy
unzipping intensifies
anime girls
69
hi
i'm sad now
you're goddamn right
ooooof
she's a girl
khajiit has wares if you ask me
