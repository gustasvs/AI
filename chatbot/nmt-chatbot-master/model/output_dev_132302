and then you get the spirit
and a very good way to pay for it
she's a good boy
i'm not sure what's the reference
the most important part of the planet
he's a hero
the memes are gonna be the same
she's a woman
i'm not sure you're just a poor man
i'm not sure how to wear a little bit
because you're not allowed to make it happen
i wish i was a good boy
pulls out meat scepter
i'm not gay but i'm not gay
i'm a little confused but i like it
he's a man of culture
i'm not sure how to read that
yes
smol boi
i'm not even a fan of this sub.
she's a hero
it's a repost
i'm not crying you're crying.
i'm gonna have a problem
i'm not sure you're crying
alexa play despacito
reality is often disappointing
happy birthday
cheers from the head
he's a fighter of the past
to shreds you say?
that's the spirit
that's a lot of damage
he's a fucking idiot
i'm not even mad
imagine being a rapist
that's what i thought.
the original game is the best
i'm gonna say the same thing
he's a hero
i miss jon's voice
i'm not your dad pal
i'm not sure that's a meth.
'i'm not your buddy '
you're a towel
i'm not crying you're crying
she's a keeper
i'm not your buddy friend
this is the way
i'm gonna say the n word
