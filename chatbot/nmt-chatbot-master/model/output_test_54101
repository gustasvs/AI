and the other one
and a little bit of a good day
she's a good guy
i'm not surprised it's a good thing
the real question is always in the comments
he's gonna pay the truth
the internet is the best
she's a woman
i'm not surprised she's a good one
i'm not surprised how to get it
you're right.
i was thinking the same thing
i'm not a poor man
i'm not gay but i'm not gay
i'm a man of culture
because he's a hero
i'm not even a towel
yes
big brain time
i'm not surprised that's a good thing
she's gonna be a good one
i'm not a man of culture
i'm glad i'm not crying.
i'm not even a cat.
i'm not a man of culture
i'm glad i'm in this picture
reality is often disappointing.
i'm not even a redditor.
i'm not even a virgin
he's a good one
to shreds you say?
i'm not surprised that's a good thing
i'm not sure he's a ghost
he's a hero
i'm not surprised that's a good thing
imagine the one of the implication
i'm not surprised that's a good thing
i'm not even a towel
i'm gonna go to the club
he's a hero
i love the name of the end
i'm not your dad.
i'm not a towel.
i'm not crying you're a good one
i'm not sure you're a towel
i'm not even a good one
she's a good one
i'm not crying you're right
i'm not sure you're a hero
i'm gonna go to you
