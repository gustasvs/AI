and the axe
and a very young one
i'm not sure she's a hero
i'm not sure you're crying
the most important part of the planet
he's a hero
i'm gonna be a meme
she's a woman
i'm sorry i'm in the first half
i'm not sure how to get that
because you're not allowed to be a mod
i wish i was a good boy
pulls out meat scepter
i'm not gay but i'm not gay
i'm a little confused but i'm not alone
he's a hero
i'm not sure it's a good way to spell
yes
smol boi
i'm not even a fan of this
she's a hero
it's a repost
i'm not crying you're crying.
i'm not a fan of the cat.
i'm not sure you're a hero
alexa play despacito
reality is often disappointing
happy birthday
oh yeah
he's a hero
to be fair she's a good guy
that's the spirit
that's a lot of damage
i'm sure he's a hero
i'm not a fan of the loop
i'm not sure you're not wrong
i'm not sure you're just a man of culture
i'm not sure it's a feature
i'm gonna say the same thing
he's a hero
i also choose this guy's dead wife
i'm not your dad pal
i'm not sure it's a feature.
i'm not sure you're just a little bitch
you're a towel
i'm a good boy
she's a keeper
i'm not your buddy friend
this is the way
i'm gonna say the same thing
